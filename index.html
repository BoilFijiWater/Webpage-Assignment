      <h1>My hobbies are drawing and play video games</h1>
      <p>I like to draw because when I draw I can draw what I want. Such as for clothes because my cousins and I want to make a clothing website, cartoons characters and random stuff.</p>
      <p>The games that I like to play are cod ww2 amd Battlefield 1.</p>
